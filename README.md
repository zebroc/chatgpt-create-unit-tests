# chatgpt-create-unit-tests

A GitHub Action that analyses a Pull Request and adds unit tests if necessary / possible

## Usage

Example to put into your action YAML file:

```
name: Suggest tests for new functions

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Suggest tests for new functions
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    - name: Create patch file & store in workspace
      run: git diff origin/${GITHUB_BASE_REF} origin/${GITHUB_HEAD_REF} &> ${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/patch
    - name: Ask ChatGPT for unit tests for new functions
      uses: zebroc/chatgpt-create-unit-tests@master
      env:
        OPENAI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_TOKEN }}
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The important parts are the "with: fetch-depth: 0" option for the checkout action so that he entire history is there and
providing your OpenAI token as a secret called "OPENAI_TOKEN". GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically provided by GitHub, it
just needs the right permissions:

To allow the comment on PRs, you need to go to Settings --> Actions --> General --> Workflow permissions
and select the option "Read and write permissions". This action will not fail if you don't do this, but
no commenting will happen.

If you want more putput, you can set a DEBUG environment variable, like so:

```
â€¦
    - name: Ask ChatGPT for unit tests for new functions
      uses: zebroc/chatgpt-create-unit-tests@master
      env:
        OPENAI_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_TOKEN }}
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        DEBUG: true
```
